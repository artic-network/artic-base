# artic-base
A base template for an implementation of an ARTIC install. This can be forked and modified for specific use-cases. To do this, click the green 'Use this template' button above. You can then give your new repo a name.

You can modify the existing files to suit your use-case but avoid moving or renaming any files or directories that are in this template.

If the template is updated, you will be able to merge these changes into your repository as needed.
